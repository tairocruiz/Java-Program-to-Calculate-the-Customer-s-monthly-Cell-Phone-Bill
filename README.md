Write a Java program that computes a customer’s monthly cell phone bill given the number of minutes
used. The program should take in two integer command-line arguments—one for the number of peak
minutes used, and one for the number of weekend and night minutes used. Each customer pays
TSh.10000/= a month, which includes 400 peak minutes and 750 weekend and night minutes. The price
for going over the allotted time is TSh.150/= per minute for both peak and weekend/night calls
